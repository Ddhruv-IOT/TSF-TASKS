# TFS-GRIP-TASK-1

## TASK:
- To make a machine learning model that can predict the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.
- Predict percentage of student who studies for 9.25 hrs.

## Implementation: 
To predict marks based on the number of hours of study, we will use Linear Regression Model in python of sklearn lib.
<br/> The model will take No. of Hours as input.
<br/> The output predicted by the model will be the percentage of the student.

## Formula used: 
y = (m * x) + b

## Tools and Technology used:
- Python 3.8
- Jupyter Notebook

## Example: 
No. of Hours Studied : 9.25
<br/> Predicted Score      : 92.39%
